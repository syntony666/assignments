## Assignment 1

### Due: 11:59 p.m., 5 March 2019


**For this assignment, please put all your tests in test_string.h and set the output file to bin/ut_all**


### Purpose of this assignment:
Let students practice to search information from document on website.

### Problems:

In class, you have learned and written the unit test for std::string. For this assignment, you have to write the more test cases for the member functions of std::string, and you don't need to write any other code. You can refer the [std::string](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/?kw=string) document in cplusplus.com.

Please implement the tests for the following member functions:

- string::length (12%)
- string::empty (12%)
- string::clear (12%)
- string::insert (12%)
- string::copy (12%)
- string::compare (12%)
- string::swap (12%)
- string::find(16%)   
(For this function, you have to write at least two test cases for different scenarios. )


Note:
1. Please implement your test cases reasonably, or you will get no point for that sub-problem.
2. _TA project will not be used in this assignment
